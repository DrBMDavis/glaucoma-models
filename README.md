RGC position and cell size dataset

This dataset includes the spatial positions (x,y) of entire RGC cell populations from rodent retinal whole mounts as point pattern processes, marked by the size of each cell soma. The window of observation is a polygon outlining the area of each retinal wholemount.

This dataset was created using histological Brn3a labeling of RGC soma followed by automated image segmentation as previously described in the paper available here: https://www.nature.com/articles/cddiscovery201631 

Dataset includes images from control (CONTROL), ocular hypertension (OHT) and partial optic nerve transection (PONT) models.

Images taken at a range of timepoints (3 days to 84 days) after model induction.
